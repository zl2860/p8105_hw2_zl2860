# Problem 1

## read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet

``` r
trash_wheel <- read_excel("./dataset/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = 1) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%  # adjust variable names
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%  # omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
  select(dumpster:homes_powered) %>% # omit non-data columns containing notes
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls))) # round & convert data type
```

## read and clean the precipitation data for 2018 sheet

``` r
# clean the data
prec_2018 <- read_excel("./dataset/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = 3, skip = 1)%>%
  janitor::clean_names()%>%
  drop_na(month,total)%>%
  mutate(year = 2018)
```

## read and clean the precipitation data for 2017 sheet

``` r
#clean the data
prec_2017 <- read_excel("./dataset/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx", sheet = 4, skip = 1)%>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
    drop_na(month,total) %>%
    mutate(year = 2017)
```

## combine precipitation datasets and convert month to a character variable

``` r
# combine data 
prec_17_18 <- bind_rows(prec_2017,prec_2018) %>%
  select(month, year, total) %>% # arrange the order of the columns
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) 
```

### Data Interpretation

The `trash_wheel` dataset includes general information on the dumpster
number, date of collection, amount of total litter, litter type and the
number of homes that are powered by collecting and processing trash. The
`trash_wheel` dataset has 285 observations with 14 variables and the
`prec_17_18` dataset with precipitation data in 2017 and 2018 has 19
observations with 3 variables. For the `trash_wheel` dataset, key
variables are `weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles,
polystyrene, cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags,
sports_balls, homes_powered`. These variables contain the most core
information that should be taken into account when researchers raise a
specific question. In contrast, variables like dumpster, month, year,
date do not contain very specific information like litter type or litter
volume but serve as important roles for indexing and grouping data. When
researchers put forward a question like " Is there any difference of the
total litter weights among different years?“, indexing and grouping in
the dataset become necessary. Therefore, these variables are also
important and cannot be dropped without any consideration. For
the”combined\_17\_18" dataset, the principle is similar. The key
variable is total. The `year` and `month` variables do not indicate the
amount of trash but serve as unique index for each total value.

The total precipitation in 2018 was 23.5 and the median number of sports
balls in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

# Promblem 2

## clean the data in “pols-month.csv”

``` r
pols_month <- read_csv("./dataset/pols-month.csv") %>%
  separate(mon,
           c("year", "month", "day"),
           remove = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)],
         president = ifelse(prez_dem == "0","gop","dem")) %>%  
  # Here if the the value of `prez_dem` is 2, we still treat it as 1
  select(-day, -prez_dem, -prez_gop)
```

## clean the Data in “snp.csv”

``` r
snp <- read_csv("./dataset/snp.csv") %>%
  separate(date,
           c("month","day","year")) %>%
  select(year,month,everything(),-day)%>%
  mutate(month = month.abb[as.numeric(month)])
```

## tidy the unemployment data

``` r
unemployment <- read_csv("./dataset/unemployment.csv") %>%
  pivot_longer( Jan:Dec,
                names_to = "month",
                values_to = "percentage"
  ) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%  # clean names only after the month names become values
  mutate( year = as.character(year))%>%
  select(year, month, everything())%>%
  drop_na(percentage) # drop missing values
```

The `percentage` is the key variable of the `unemployment` dataset. I
dropped these rows with missing values of this variable because the
content of the resulting merged dataset will not be changed even if I
keep these rows in the original dataset.

## join the datasets

``` r
merged_problem2 <- full_join(full_join(pols_month,snp),unemployment)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")
    ## Joining, by = c("year", "month")

``` r
# To make sure all of the information is included, I used full_join() to merge the datasets
```

## Data Interpretation

The `pols_month` dataset has 822 observations of 9 variables and
includes the information on the number of national politicians who are
democratic or republican at any given time.

The `snp` dataset has 787 observations of 3 variables and includes the
information on the closing values of the S\&P stock index on the
associated date.

The `unemployment` dataset has 810 observations of 3 varaibles and
includes information on percentage of unemployment in each month of the
associated year.

The dimension of the resulting dataset `merged_problem2` is 823, 11. The
range of years is from 1947 to 2015. Key variables in this dataset are
`gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president, close,
percentage`.

# Problem 3

## Load and tidy the data

``` r
Popular_Baby_Names <- read_csv("./dataset/Popular_Baby_Names.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(gender = str_to_lower(gender),
         ethnicity = str_to_lower(recode(ethnicity,
                            "ASIAN AND PACI" = "ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER",
                            "BLACK NON HISP" = "BLACK NON HISPANIC" ,
                            "WHITE NON HISP" = "WHITE NON HISPANIC"
                            )),
         childs_first_name = str_to_title(childs_first_name) )%>%
  distinct()
```
